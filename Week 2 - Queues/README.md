# Deques and Randomized Queue
A double-ended queue or deque (pronounced “deck”) is a generalization of a stack and a queue that supports adding and removing items from either the front or the back of the data structure. A randomized queue is similar to a stack or queue, except that the item removed is chosen uniformly at random among items in the data structure.
# Assignment
The goal of this assignment is to implement elementary data structures using arrays and linked lists, and to introduce you to generics and iterators.
# Conclusion
Project involves my solution to the deques and randomized queue assignment. My work consists of Deque.java, RandomizedQueue.java and Permutation.java.
